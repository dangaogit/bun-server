# Best Practices (English Draft)

The Chinese document (`docs/best-practices.md`) is the source of truth. This file lists the
main topics that still need translation:

- Coding conventions & comment style
- Logger usage (English-only requirement)
- Recommended middleware layering
- Testing strategy
- Benchmark workflow

Help us by submitting translations or summaries for each section.
